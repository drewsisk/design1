    <h1 style="text-align:center">OK ART Manifesto</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center">by <a href="http://www.susie-ramsay-artist.com/>"</a> Susie Ramsay</a> and <a href="https://www.lozano-hemmer.com/glories_of_accounting.php"</a> Rafael Lozano-Hemmer </h2></a>
    <p> 1. "OK art" is an OK idea, --not great, but not bad either. </p>
    <p> 2. OK artists make OK art. </p>
    <p> 3. OK artists really want to make great art, they shoot for the stars, but
their work ends up being just OK. OK artists are OK with this. </p>
    <p> 4. Art enthusiasts and cynics alike, leave an OK art exhibition saying
"that was OK". No one is blown away but they don't feel cheated either. </p>
    <p> 5. OK art will probably not make it into art history; although someone in
the future might find an OK artwork and think "this isn't so bad." </p>
    <p> 6. "Different" and "interesting" are two adjectives often overheard at OK
art exhibitions. </p>
    <p> 7. OK artists are OK with bad reviews, but naturally they prefer good
reviews and they keep those and post them on the internet. </p>
    <p> 8. It's a good idea to call yourself an OK artist before somebody else
does. </p>
    <p> 9. Ambitious, megalomaniac artists feel great relief when they accept
they're just OK. </p>
    <p> 10. OK ideas are defended passionately but not more than that. </p>
    <p> 12. OK art is unlikely to be over or underrated. </p>
    <p> 13. We hate artists that are A-OK, those bastards! </p>
    <p> 14. There is no point in making an OK art movement, although fleeting
consideration of the concept would be OK. </p>
